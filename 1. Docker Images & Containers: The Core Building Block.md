# Docker Images & Containers: The Core Building Blocks

- Docker is an isolated container. It have it’s own internal network. To interact with, we have to expose a port from docker to our system

# Containers vs Images

- Container is the running “Unit of Software”
- Image is
    - Template/Blueprint for containers
    - Contains code + required tools/runtimes
        
        ![image.png](Assets/Docker%20Images%20&%20Containers%20The%20Core%20Building%20Block/image.png)
        
- So an image is used to run multiple containers.

## Images

- Use docker hub to find images built by community

```docker
docker run node
```

- It pulls the latest node image from docker hub
- It runs as a container

```docker
docker ps -a
ps = process 
```

- It will return all the process running by docker
- The above docker run node command doesn’t expose the interactive shell by default. To do that

```docker
docker run -it node
-it = interactive
```

- Images hold all the logic and code and container is an instance of an image which runs the code
- run command creates a container

## Building our own image

- create a new file : Dockerfile
- Dockerfile

```docker
FROM node (we are using some base image to build our own image)

WORKDIR /app (setting the working directory. All the commands will be run in this directory)

COPY . /app (first dot indicates, all folders and sub-folders should be copied from root Dockerfile to docker environment folder. )

RUN npm install (as we set workdir, this command will run in /app)

~~RUN node server.js~~ (this is not correct because we are telling the image to run but here image is a blueprint.)

EXPOSE 80 (We are exposing the port to outside of docker. This is just for documentation)

CMD ["node", "server.js"] (CMD will run when a container is initlised out of image. And RUN command executes while building the image. If you don't 
specify a CMD, the CMD of the base image will be executed. With no base image and no CMD, you'd get an error. CMD should be the last command in the
Dockerfile)

```

- Building the image

```docker
docker build .
. = same folder
```

- copy the image id and run

```docker
docker run <image_id>
```

```docker
docker stop <container_name>
```

```docker
docker run -p 3000:80 <image_id> 
-p = port flag
<port1>:<port2> = port1 is local port we want to use and port2 is docker image exposed port
```

- Image is read-only
- Any change in source files, requires a rebuild of image

## Image Layers

- An image is built using multiple image layers
    - Each instruction is an image layer
- Image is read-only
- When an image is used to run a Container, It adds a container layer (read-write) on top of image layers
- When nothing changes, image is built using Cache
- When a layer re-runs, all subsequent layers also re-runs. So to optimise the above Dockerfile to not re-install npm packages every time, we can do the below optimisation

```docker
FROM node

WORKDIR /app

COPY package.json /app

RUN npm install

COPY . /app

EXPOSE 80

CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

## Managing Images & Containers

- `docker ps` (running containers)
- `docker ps -a` (including stopped containers)
- `docker start <id or name>` (restart the stopped container)

### Understanding Attached and Detached Containers

- `docker start` runs in detached (not listening) mode
- `docker run` runs in attached (listening) mode

To run docker in Detached mode using `run`

- `docker run -p 8080:80 -d <image_id>` here `-d` specifies the detached mode
    - To attach back to the running container `docker attach <container_name>`

To check logs of detached container

- `docker logs <id or name>`
- `docker logs -f <id or name>` to go back into attached mode

To start in attached mode by default

- `docker start -a <id or image>` where `-a` adds attached mode

## Running an Interactive shell using Docker

Let’s say we want to dockerise a python script which takes in user input.

```docker
FROM python

WORKDIR /app

COPY . /app

CMD ["python", "file.py"]
```

when we build with `docker build .` and run using `docker run <id>` it fails as this command doesn’t mention interactivity.

To fix this

- `docker run -t -i <id>` where `-t` represent terminal and `-i` represent interactivity
- When we restart the container using `docker start -a <id>` it behaves incorrectly as we have to add `-i` for interactivity again
    - `docker start -a -i <id>`

### Deleting images and Containers

Containers

- `docker rm` removes container
    - Running containers can be removed after stopping
- `docker rm <id or name, id or name>` multiple can be removed by `,` separated

Images

- `docker images` list the images
- `docker rmi` to remove image
    - `docker rmi <id>` . Only can be removed if they are not being used in container (running or stopped)
    - `docker rmi id id id` to remove multiple images
- `docker image prune` removes not being used images
    - To remove images and tags, run `docker image prune -a`

### Remove container when it stopped

`docker run -p 3000:80 --rm <image id>` here `--rm` removes when the container completely when stopped.

### Inspecting Images

`docker image inspect <image id>`

### Copy files into or from container

Copy from local path to running container

- `docker cp <from local path> <container_name>:<path>`

Copy from container to local 

- `docker cp <container>:<path> <local path>`

 

### Naming images and containers

Naming a container

- `docker run --name <name> <image>`

Image

- Images have two things `name:tag` where `name` groups similar images and `tag` is to specify some kind of version. Ex: `node:12 or node:14` here `node` is `name` and `12 or 14` is `tag`
- `docker build -t <name>:<tag> .`

### Renaming Images

`docker tag <old image> <new image>`

- It creates a clone of the old image with new tag

### Sharing images and containers

- Sharing Dockerfile
- Sharing a Built image

Pushing to Docker hub or Private Registry

Login to docker using

`docker login`

- Docker requires the name to be present locally in order to push to docker hub or any other registry
- `docker push jokr123/node-hello-world`
