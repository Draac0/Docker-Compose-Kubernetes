# Managing Data & Volumes with Kubernetes

## Understanding State

State is data created and used by your application which must not be lost

- User-generated data, user accounts, etc
    - Often stored in a database, but could also be files (e.g. uploads)
- Intermediate results derived by the app
    - Often stored in memory, temporary database tables or files

We store this state using `Volumes` 

Kubernetes needs to be configured to add `Volumes` to our `Containers` 

## Kubernetes & Volumes

Kubernetes can mount Volumes into Containers

- A board variety of Volume types / drivers are supported
    - `Local` volumes (i.e. on Nodes)
    - `Cloud-provider` specific volumes
- Volume lifetime depends on the Pod lifetime
    - Volumes survive Container restarts (and removal)
    - Volumes are removed when Pods are destroyed

## Docker vs Kubernetes

| Kubernetes Volumes                              | Docker Volumes                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Supports many different Drivers and Types       | Basically no Driver / Type Support              |
| Volumes are not necessarily persistent          | Volumes persist until manually cleared          |
| Volumes survive Container restarts and removals | Volumes survive Container restarts and removals |

## Getting Started With Kubernetes Volumes

All these Driver types specified below and in the official documentation might overwhelm but they are just different storage options (in simple terms how they store the data outside of a container). Every driver stores differently and we see some of them below.

Volumes are Specific to Pods.

### A First Volume: The “emptyDir” Type

- emptyDir creates a new empty directory and fills the data inside of it. This is alive until our Pod is alive.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: story-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: story
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: story
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: story
          image: jokr123/kub-data-demo:2
          volumeMounts: 
            - mountPath: /app/story # containr internal path where we want to bind
              name: story-volume
      volumes:
        - name: story-volume
          emptyDir: {}

```

And restart the deployment and test it. 

Downside:

- If we have 2 replicas (pods) and one pod is crashed, then the requests are routed to another pod where the volume is different. So for this kind of scenario we use a different volume driver type

### A Second Volume: The “hostPath” Type

A `hostPath` volume mounts a file or directory from the host node’s filesystem into your Pod. This is not something that most Pods will need, but it offers a powerful escape hatch for some applications

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: story-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: story
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: story
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: story
          image: jokr123/kub-data-demo:2
          volumeMounts: 
            - mountPath: /app/story # containr internal path where we want to bind
              name: story-volume
      volumes:
        - name: story-volume
          hostPath: 
            path: /data # similar to bind mount (local machine path)
            type: DirectoryOrCreate # Its a directory and create if it doesn't exist

```

### Understanding CSI Volume Type

CSI stands for `Container Storage Interface` and its a very flexible volume type.

Kubernetes team exposed this `interface` so that anyone can write their own volume driver.

## From Volumes to Persistent Volumes

Persistent volumes are independent of Node and Pod

The Volume is detached from the Pod life cycle

### Storage Class

Advanced concept

`kubectl get sc` where `sc` stands for `storage class` 

### Persistent Volume Object

`host-pv.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolume
metadata:
  name: host-pv
spec:
  capacity:
    storage: 1Gi
  volumeMode: Filesystem # filesystem or block
  storageClassName: standard
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
    # - ReadOnlyMany
    # - ReadWriteMany
  hostPath:
    path: /Data
    type: DirectoryOrCreate
```

### Creating Persistent Volume Claim

`host-pvc.yaml` 

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: host-pvc
spec:
  volumeName: host-pv
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi

```

### Updated Deployment

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: story-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: story
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: story
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: story
          image: jokr123/kub-data-demo:2
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /app/story # containr internal path where we want to bind
              name: story-volume
      volumes:
        - name: story-volume
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: host-pvc

```

### Run

`kubectl apply -f=host-pv.yaml` 

`kubectl apply -f=host-pvc.yaml` 

`kubectl apply -f=deployment.yaml` 

`kubectl get pv` 

`kubectl get pvc`
