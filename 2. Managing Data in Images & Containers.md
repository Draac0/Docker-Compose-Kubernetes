# Managing Data in Images & Containers

- Volumes helps to persist data even if the container is removed
- Volumes are stored inside host machine so they are persisted even if the container is removed
- A container can write data into a volume and read data from it

```docker
VOLUME ["/app/feedback"]
```

### Two types of External Data Storages

1. Volumes (Managed by Docker)
    1. Anonymous Volumes
        1. Docker sets up a folder/path on your host machine, exact location is unknown and managed via `docker volume`  commands
        2. This volume gets deleted once the container is removed
    2. Named Volumes
        1. Great for data which should be persistent but which you don’t need to edit directly
2. Bind Mounts (Managed by you)

### Named Volumes

`docker run -v <volume name>:<path in container> <image>` 

Named volumes are specified in the command itself. It’s not added inside the Dockerfile.

  

### Bind Mounts

- You define a folder/path on your host machine
- This is helpful to reload the changes without re-building everything entirely

Binding is similar to named volumes except we map path in local machine to path in the container

- `docker run -v "<exact path in local machine>:<path in container>" <image>`

Docker should have access to the files you are sharing

Just a quick note: If you don't always want to copy and use the full path, you can use these **shortcuts**:

**macOS / Linux**: `-v $(pwd):/app`

**Windows**: `-v "%cd%":/app`

Here is the other problem. If there are `node_modules` required in the container but they are not present in the local machine because we installed them in the image. Now because of `Bind Mounts` our local code overwrites the container `node_modules` . To fix this, we use `Anonymous Volumes` like this

- `docker run -v "<exact path in local machine>:<path in container>" -v /app/node_modules <image>` or you can specify it in the `Dockerfile` like `VOLUME ["/app/node_modules"]`
- This works because docker overwrites with the specified path in the volume

One more thing to notice in Bind Mounts is that they are both readable and writable vice-versa. Local can read and write to Container and vice versa. To change the behaviour of Container to read only, we can append a specific key to the end of the volume path like `docker run -v "<exact path>:<path in container>:ro"`  here `ro` is read `read only` . If there are any paths that container is trying to make changes that are necessary, then create an `Anonymous Volume` to override the behaviour of that particular path.

### .dockerignore file

`node_modules` 

### Working with ENVironment Variable and ARGuments

Docker supports build time ARGuments and runtime ENVironment variables

ARGuments:

- Available inside of Dockerfile, NOT accessible in CMD or any application code
- Set on image build (dovker build) via —build-arg

in `Dockerfile` 

```docker
ARG DEFAULT_PORT=80
```

while building docker

- `docker build -t <image> --build-arg DEFAULT_PORT=8000 .`

ENViroment:

- Available inside of Dockerfile & in application code
- Set via ENV in Dockerfile or via —env on docker run
    - `docker run --env PORT=8000` or `docker run -e PORT=8000 -e XYZ=something`
    - `docker run --env-file ./.env` to read env from env file where `./` represents current folder
