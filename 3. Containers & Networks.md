# Containers & Networks

There are different communications a container might do

- Calling some external api in WWW
- Connecting to some resources in the container host machine
- Multi Container Communication

WWW is directly accessible from a container. No extra setup is required for it. ✅

To connect to network resources in host machine use `host.docker.internal`  as `domain`.

ex: using `localhost` , in place of `localhost` use `host.docker.internal` which docker understands.

For Multi Container communication:

- First do `docker container inspect mongodb` here we are using mongodb
- In `inspect` you can find the `IPAddress` which is the running address of that container
- Use that address in the `domain`

### Networks (Elegant way of doing multi container)

`docker run --network my_network` 

Within a docker network, all containers can communicate with each other and IPs are automatically resolved

Unlike `volumes` where docker creates the volume if not there, `networks` should be manually created.

- `docker network create mongodb-network`

Previously we inspected the container to find the network IP and updated that in the mongodb domain uri so our app container can talk with mongodb container.

Now, with the help of networks they can be changed to the container name itself.

before: `mongdb://127.0.0.2:27017/fav` 

after: `mongdb://mongodb:27017/fav` where `mongodb` is my mongodb container name running in a network

Run command using network

`docker run --rm -d --name mongodb --network mongodb-network mongo` (for mongo db container)

`docker run --rm -d --name fav -p 3000:3000 --network mongodb-network fav-app:latest` (for our node js application which uses mongo db internally)

`Ports` like `-p` tag are published only when `local` needs to talk to container. Here we are using docker networks for container-container communication which doesn’t require publishing a port.

### How docker resolves the IP

Docker `won't` read the `source code` . What it does is, it is aware of network calls happening inside the container (environment it owns) and resolves the IP at that moment. Its very efficient way.

### Docker Network Drivers

Docker Networks actually support different kinds of "**Drivers**" which influence the behavior of the Network.

The default driver is the "**bridge**" driver - it provides the behavior shown in this module (i.e. Containers can find each other by name if they are in the same Network).

The driver can be set when a Network is created, simply by adding the `--driver` option.

`docker network create --driver bridge my-net`

*Of course, if you want to use the "bridge" driver, you can simply omit the entire option since "bridge" is the default anyways.*

Docker also supports these alternative drivers - though you will use the "bridge" driver in most cases:

- **`host`**: For standalone containers, isolation between container and host system is removed (i.e. they share localhost as a network)
- **`overlay`**: Multiple Docker daemons (i.e. Docker running on different machines) are able to connect with each other. Only works in "Swarm" mode which is a dated / almost deprecated way of connecting multiple containers
- **`macvlan`**: You can set a custom MAC address to a container - this address can then be used for communication with that container
- **`none`**: All networking is disabled.
- **`Third-party plugins`**: You can install third-party plugins which then may add all kinds of behaviors and functionalities

As mentioned, the "**bridge**" driver makes most sense in the vast majority of scenarios.
