# Kubernetes Networking

## Arch 1 (Internal Pod Communication)

![image.png](Assets/Kubernetes%20Networking/image.png)

Auth API, Users API, and Tasks API are three independent projects and independent `Containers` in the `Kubernetes` 

### Pod Internal Communication

If multiple containers exists in one in the same Pod, they can communication using `localhost` domain.

### Yaml Files for the Above Arch

`user-deployment.yaml` 

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: users-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: users
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: users
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: users
          image: jokr123/kub-demo-users:2
          resources:
            limits:
              memory: "128Mi"
              cpu: "500m"
          env:
            - name: AUTH_ADDRESS
              value: localhost
        - name: auth
          image: jokr123/kub-demo-auth:1

## Arch 2 (Individual Pods with Internal Networking)

### Pod-Pod Internal Communication

So here, Auth is not accessible directly by outside world. Auth API pod service type is `ClusterIP` which does some kind of load balancing. Now for `Users API` / `Tasks API` to communicate with the `Auth API` Pod, they either have to manually get the IP of that Pod by doing `kubectl get services` which returns the `Auth API` IP.

But this is bit annoying. So to solve this, `Kubernetes` exposes some special environment variables. 

ex: Letâ€™s say your service name is `auth-service` . So the `env` variable for the `Host IP` will be `AUTH_SERVICE_SERVICE_HOST` where `AUTH_SERVICE` prefix is based on the service name you provided and `SERVICE_HOST` is added by Kubernetes. Unfortunately we have to manage these in Docker Compose with the same exact `env` keys (We can manage that)

`auth-service.yaml` 

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: auth-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: auth
  ports:
    - protocol: 'TCP'
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: ClusterIP

```

`auth-deployment.yaml` 

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: auth-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: auth
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: auth
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: auth
          image: jokr123/kub-demo-auth:1
          resources:
            limits:
              memory: "128Mi"
              cpu: "500m"
```

`user-service.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: users-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: users
  ports:
    - protocol: 'TCP'
      port: 8080
      targetPort: 8080
  type: LoadBalancer

```

`user-deployment.yaml` 

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: users-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: users
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: users
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: users
          image: jokr123/kub-demo-users:2
          resources:
            limits:
              memory: "128Mi"
              cpu: "500m"
          env:
            - name: AUTH_ADDRESS
              value: 10.98.3.137

```

### Using DNS for Pod-to-Pod Communication

DNS stands for Domain Name Service. In `Kubernetes` we can use this cluster DNS to communicate internally with other Pods.

There is a concept called `Namespaces` . We can get these using `kubectl get namespaces` .

So the DNS looks like this, `<service-name>.<namespace>` 

ex: If we want to use `AUTH_ADDRESS` env, currently we are either copying the IP or use the Kubernetes exposed ENV. But instead we can change it to `auth-service.default` where `auth-service` is the name we have provided in the YAML file of `auth-service.yaml` and `default` is the namespace where our cluster belongs to.

`user-deployment.yaml` 

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: users-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: users
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: users
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: users
          image: jokr123/kub-demo-users:2
          resources:
            limits:
              memory: "128Mi"
              cpu: "500m"
          env:
            - name: AUTH_ADDRESS
              # value: 10.98.3.137
              value: "auth-service.default"

```

### Which Approach is Best?

`Domain` names are the best way of interacting between Pods.
