# Deploying Docker Containers

- `Bind mounts shouldn't` be used in production
- Containerised apps `might need a build step (eg. react apps)`
- `Multi-Container projects` might need to be `split` (or should be split) across multiple hosts / remote machines
- `Trade-offs` between `control` and `responsibility` might be worth it

Lets deploy a simple node js application. Below is the deployment approach of that

### Bind Mounts, Volumes & COPY

`In Development` 

- Containers should encapsulate the runtime env but not necessarily the code
- Use “Bind Mounts” to provide your local host project files to the running container
- Allows for instant updates without restarting the container

`In Production` 

- A container should really work standalone, you should `NOT` have source code on your remote machine
- Image / Container is the `single source of truth`
- Use `COPY` to copy code snapshot into the image
- Ensures that every images runs without any extra, surrounding code and configuration

### Deploying Source Code vs Image

`Option 1: Deploy Source` 

- Build image on remote machine
- Push source code to remote machine, run docker build and then docker run
- Unnecessary complexity

`Option 2: Deploy Built Image`

- Build image before deployment (eg. on local machine)
- Just execute docker run
- Avoid unnecessary remote server work

 

### A Managed / Automated Approach

- `Remote machines (EC2)` ( We have to manage )
    - You need to create them, manage them, keep them updated, monitor them, scale them etc
- `Managed Remote Machines ECS` (Elastic Container Service) is a managed service by AWS
    - Creation, management, updating is handled automatically, monitoring and scaling is simplified

### A simple Deployment Architecture

### Issues with Build step (in React, Vue, Next, Nest etc )

Optimisation script that needs to be executed `AFTER development` but `BEFORE deployment` 

 

`Creating a BUILD only Container` 

`Dockerfile.prod`

```docker
FROM node:16 # specific node version

WORKDIR /app

COPY package.json /

RUN npm install

COPY . .

CMD ["npm", "run", "build"]
```

The above will not work

`Introducing Multi-Stage Builds` 

One Dockerfile, Multiple Build / Setup Steps (”Stages”)

- Stages can copy results (created files and folders) from each other
- You can either build the completed image or select individual stages

`Dockerfile.prod`

```docker
# stage 1

FROM node:16 as build

WORKDIR /app

COPY package.json /

RUN npm install

COPY . .

RUN npm run build

# we don't need node anymore because we did build the code

# stage 2

FROM nginx:stable-alpine

# Copy from build stage, and specify the source path and destination path
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

EXPOSE 80

# start the nginx
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

### Building a Multi Stage Dockerfile

`docker build -f Dockerfile.prod -t <tag> .` here `-f` refers to the `path` of the `Dockerfile` we wish to use in build process

We can also target specific build targets

`docker build --target <stage> -f Dockerfile.prod -t <tag> .`
