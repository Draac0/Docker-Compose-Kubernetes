# Getting Started With Kubernetes

Specific Way of Deploying Docker Containers using Kubernetes For Large Scale Deployments

An open-source system for orchestrating container deployments

- Automatic deployment
- Scaling & Load balancing
- Management

Pass `Kubernetes Configuration` to any provider to manage.

- Cloud provider doesnâ€™t matter with Kubernetes unlike `ECS`
- Cloud provider specific config can also be added

`Kubernetes is like Docker-Compose for Multiple Machines` 

### Core Kubernetes Concepts & Architecture

### Your Work / Kubernetes Work

`What you need to Do / Setup (i.e. what Kubernetes requires)`

- Create the cluster and node instances (Worker + Master nodes)
- Setup API server, kubelet and other Kubernetes services / software on Nodes
- Create other (cloud) provider resources that might be needed (e.g. Load Balancer, Filesystems)

`What Kubernetes Will Do`

- Create your objects (e.g. Pods) and manage them
- Monitor Pods and re-create them, scale pods etc
- Kubernetes utilizes the provided (cloud) resources to apply your configuration / goals

### A closer look at Worker Nodes

### Closer look at Master Node

## Core Concepts

Below are some terms used in `Kubernetes` system. 

### Cluster

A set of `Node` machines which are running the `Containerized` Application (`Worker Nodes` ) or control other Nodes (`Master Node` )

### Nodes

`Physical or Virtual machine` with a certain hardware capacity which hosts `one or multiple Pods` and `communicates` with the Cluser

- `Master node`
    - Cluster `Control plane, managing the pods` across worker nodes
- `Worker node`
    - Hosts Pods, `running App Containers` (+ `resources` )

### Pods

Pods `hold the actual running App Containers` + their `required resources` (e.g. Volumes)

### Containers

Normal (Docker) Containers

### Services

A `logical set (group) of Pods` with a unique, Pod- and Container- `independent IP address`
